It is designed for structured definition and to manage the complex interaction between different views (structure and language) and different branches (personal and master) across modules and chatbots effectively. If you have used Git in your development, this process should be very familiar to you.</p><p>OpenCUI workflow is a branch-based workflow. After you tested your changes, it&#39;s important to ask project owner to review your changes and ensure they meet the chatbot&#39;s features and quality standards, by opening a pull request and comparing the changes across your branch. Once your change is approved, you can merge them into the master. For more information on working with branch and reviewing changes, please refer to the <a href="./../reference/platform/versioncontrol.html">Version control</a> section.</p><h2 id="before-you-start" tabindex="-1">Before you start <a class="header-anchor" href="#before-you-start" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Before you start&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To follow OpenCUI flow, you will need to <a href="./signingup.html#sign-up">sign up</a> for a OpenCUI account and log into <a href="https://build.opencui.io/login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenCUI</a> platform. Make sure to complete the steps outlined in the <a href="./build-simple-chatbot.html">Build a chatbot</a> guide. The steps in this guide build upon the chatbot created in the previous guide.</p><h2 id="always-in-your-branch" tabindex="-1">Always in your branch <a class="header-anchor" href="#always-in-your-branch" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Always in your branch&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When you start building a project, such as creating a type, adding or modifying an instance, a branch is automatically created for you based on the current master. This gives you a space to work on your changes without affecting the master. You can work on your changes in isolation from the changes that other people are making. Additionally, creating a branch gives your collaborators a chance to review your changes before you merge them into the master. In OpenCUI, you can only have one active branch per project.</p><h2 id="propagate-the-changes-to-language-view" tabindex="-1">Propagate the changes to language view <a class="header-anchor" href="#propagate-the-changes-to-language-view" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Propagate the changes to language view&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When you start building a project that includes language-specific parts, such as chatbots and modules, OpenCUI can help you create a consistent experience across all languages by propagating changes. This means that you don&#39;t need to duplicate your work or repeat the process for each language which makes it easy to create and maintain language-specific parts.</p><p>You can simply define the schema layer and interaction layer data you need in the structure view, and then propagate those changes to all of the language views. This will ensure that all of your language-specific parts are always in sync and that you don&#39;t have to waste time duplicating your work, you can simply fill in the blanks with the appropriate language.</p><p>To propagate the changes to language view:</p><ol><li><p>In the <strong>Structure</strong> view, click <strong>Propagate</strong> in the upper-right corner of the Types area.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="propagate interaction change"></p></li><li><p>Once you have propagated the changes to the language view, you can switch to the specific language in the <strong>Language Selector</strong>.

If you make a mistake, you can undo your changes or revert to your latest commit. Your changes will not be added to the master branch until you merge your branch. To test your change using OpenCUI <strong>Debug</strong> tool, you need to commit the change first.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="commit language change"></p><h2 id="create-a-pull-request" tabindex="-1">Create a pull request <a class="header-anchor" href="#create-a-pull-request" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Create a pull request&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Once you&#39;re ready to share your work, you can create a pull request to get feedback on your changes from your collaborators. Pull requests show the changes you made in your branch compared to the master branch, which indicates that you&#39;re ready to merge your changes into the master branch.</p><p>To create a pull request:</p><ol><li>In the navigation bar, select the <strong>Versions</strong> tab.</li><li>Click <strong>Pull request</strong> in the upper-right corner of the Versions area.</li></ol><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="pingpong pull request"></p><h2 id="review-and-merge-pull-request" tabindex="-1">Review and merge pull request <a class="header-anchor" href="#review-and-merge-pull-request" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Review and merge pull request&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Collaborators can review pull request and submit reviews by marking <strong>Approve</strong> or <strong>Close</strong>.</p><p>To review changes:</p><ol><li><p>Click the item you want to review, and <strong>Compare diffs</strong> field will slide out.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="version item"></p></li><li><p>In the <strong>Compare diffs</strong> drawer, make sure all the changes are what you want.
