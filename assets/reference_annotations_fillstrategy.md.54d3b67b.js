It decides whether or when to prompt the user to fill a slot. More importantly, it also defines how other fill annotations should work together. A prompt is a customization of the dialog act SlotRequest, and it contains a template that can help verbalize the slot request dialog act. The diversity of responses can be increased by adding more templates.</p><h2 id="how-to-use" tabindex="-1">How to use <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-use" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How to use&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Prompt strategy is a composite annotation, as OpenCUI provides a set of concrete strategies to cover different use cases.

It is easy to set up:</p><ul><li>Set its Fill strategy to <strong>Always ask</strong>.</li><li>Fill in at least one template in the <strong>Prompt</strong> text input box.</li></ul><h4 id="how-to-use-1" tabindex="-1">How to use <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-use-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How to use&quot;">​</a></h4><p>If a slot is required by the business logic, you should configure the prompt strategy to Always ask. The bot will make sure that this slot is filled.
