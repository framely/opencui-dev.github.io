As such, the bot will follow a deterministic interaction logic that first determines a user&#39;s intent, triggers the corresponding skill and then aggressively fills slots of that skill one by one until it has all the required parameters to invoke the service.</p><p>However, the design bias towards favorable conditions in these standard slot filling components can sometime cumbersome for interaction logic for unhappy use case. For example, when a user wants to buy a ticket, the movie he wants is sold out. Instead of asking what showtime he likes, whether he wants IMAX, it is a better experience to simply exit conversation early:</p><div class="language-json"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">json</span><pre class="shiki material-theme-palenight"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">User: </span><span style="color:#89DDFF;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">Two tickets for Star Wars please?</span><span style="color:#89DDFF;">&quot;</span></span>

The deterministic nature warranted by this conceptual model make it easy for business to control interaction logic for their business needs, both in building and debugging phase.</p><p>In particular, each entity slot filling is essentially a deterministic state machine, that deterministically move from the start state to end state, that go through the 5 stages of slot filling based the transition table defined by corresponding CUI components. The frame slots are filled by a composite state machine that also includes the type-level CUI component, as well as the components defined on each one of its slots.</p><p>Transition is a low level annotation that give builder the ability to control the state machine directly. It is an optional type level annotation which lets you define transitions between slots hosted directly and indirectly by hosting frame.</p><p>Transition can be configured in two parts: triggering and update actions, where triggering defines under what condition the corresponding actions sequence is executed.</p><p><img src="`+s+`" alt="transition"></p><h2 id="transitions" tabindex="-1">Transitions <a class="header-anchor" href="#transitions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Transitions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Currently, we support two kinds of transitions: event triggered transitions and condition triggered transitions.</p><h3 id="event-triggered-transitions" tabindex="-1">Event triggered transitions <a class="header-anchor" href="#event-triggered-transitions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Event triggered transitions&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Given skill, the interaction logic or transition table defined by slot filling components will always try to proactively fill every it&#39;s slot, and delivery the result to user based on the filled slots. While direct slot filling is already capable for many real world use case, many advanced use cases involves no-direct slot filling.</p><p>For example, during a purchase session, the user might want to use a certain coupon by say &quot;<em>use the coupon that will expire soon</em>&quot;. Instead of responding with &quot;<em>I do not know what you are talking about</em>&quot;, you can set up an event triggered transition, with triggering event set to be &quot;CouponSelection&quot;, and actions include a fill action which can assign the coupon code that is returned from a function that retrieves the expiring coupon code for given user.</p><div class="language-json"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">json</span><pre class="shiki material-theme-palenight"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">Chatbot: </span><span style="color:#89DDFF;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">Okay lets go ahead and begin checkout.</span><span style="color:#89DDFF;">&quot;</span></span>
