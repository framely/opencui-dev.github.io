It easy to work with but operates only on single files. Meanwhile, only one user can work on a file at a time, because when editing the same file at the same time, there will be conflicts. It is very easy to accidentally overwrite an important file you never mean to.</p><p>So OpenCUI provides a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Version control</a> system, which do not rely on a shared central project and allow users to maintain independent project and communicate revisions via changesets. Everybody on the team is able to work absolutely freely on any project at any time. You know what exactly is different in these versions, your teams work faster and smarter.</p><p>For more information about providing team members with access, see <a href="./access.html">Access control</a>.</p><h2 id="working-with-branch" tabindex="-1">Working with branch <a class="header-anchor" href="#working-with-branch" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Working with branch&quot;">​</a></h2><p>OpenCUI platform is a version control system. You can collaborate with multiple members independently without affecting others. When you start building, such as adding or modifying some instances, a <strong>Branch</strong> is automatically created for you based on the current master(we call it <strong>Base</strong>). Then you can work on this branch in isolation from changes that other people are making to the project.</p><h3 id="branch-changes" tabindex="-1">Branch changes <a class="header-anchor" href="#branch-changes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Branch changes&quot;">​</a></h3><p>While you are working, you can compare the changes you made with <strong>Base</strong> through <strong>Diffs</strong>. During a comparison, if you are not satisfied with these changes or have some new ideas, you can restore your changes by <strong>Revert</strong> operation. If you are satisfied with these changes, you can save these small groups of meaningful changes via <strong>Commit</strong> and prepare for <a href="./testing.html">Testing</a>.</p><h3 id="keep-branch-in-sync" tabindex="-1">Keep branch in sync <a class="header-anchor" href="#keep-branch-in-sync" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Keep branch in sync&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Typically, when you are working, your teammates may push some changes and merge them into master. The version of master will be updated, which will cause your branch out of date. Keeping your branch up to date with the current master can help you catch problems prior. You can synchronize at any time you need via <strong>Rebase</strong>, but it&#39;s best to do this before committing and testing.</p><h3 id="resolve-merge-conflict" tabindex="-1">Resolve merge conflict <a class="header-anchor" href="#resolve-merge-conflict" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Resolve merge conflict&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There are conflicting changes, when people make different changes to the same field of the same component, or when one edits an instance and another deletes it. Sometimes, when you merge branch that have competing changes, you need to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge. You need to resolve all conflicts before you can move to the next step via <strong>Resolve Conflict</strong> by selecting the changes that you want to keep.</p><h2 id="open-pull-request" tabindex="-1">Open pull request <a class="header-anchor" href="#open-pull-request" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Open pull request&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Once you&#39;re satisfied with your work, you can open a pull request to tell others about changes you&#39;ve pushed in a project. Pull requests display diffs to compare the changes you made in your branch against the base master, which indicates you are willing to merge them into master. Others can review your proposed changes and submit reviews by marking Approve or Close.</p><p>Pull requests can only be opened when there are differences between branch and master, and you have already committed these differences. Only approved change can be merged into master.</p><h2 id="terms" tabindex="-1">Terms <a class="header-anchor" href="#terms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Terms&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Branch</strong>: Where you work in isolation from changes that other people are making to the project.
