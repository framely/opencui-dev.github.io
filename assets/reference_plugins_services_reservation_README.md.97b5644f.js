Customers often need to make appointments or reservations in advance to ensure they can get the service they need at a specific time. With the rise of chatbots and conversational interfaces, businesses have an opportunity to make the reservation process even more convenient and user-friendly for customers by allowing them to book services through a chatbot which can increase efficiency for your businesses.</p><p>For instance, if you&#39;re a restaurant owner, you may want to offer a hassle-free and convenient way for customers to book tables. By integrating a chatbot into your website or mobile app, customers can easily make reservations without having to call or email the restaurant. The chatbot can gather necessary details such as date, time, number of people, and dietary restrictions, and confirm the reservation with the customer.</p><p>Likewise, a doctor&#39;s office could use a chatbot to allow patients to schedule appointments or check their appointment status. The chatbot could ask for the patient&#39;s name, date of birth, preferred date and time for the appointment, and the reason for the appointment, and then provide confirmation and reminders.</p><p>We recognize that incorporating reservation scenarios into chatbots is a crucial element for many businesses. <strong>However, implementing these scenarios from scratch can be a daunting task. That&#39;s why we have created an abstracted reservation scenario, which can be easily imported or cloned into your chatbot project or organization</strong>.</p><p>Our reservation scenario offers a wide range of features to simplify the development of conversational user interfaces. This includes:</p><ul><li><strong>APIs</strong>: expose most of the available reservation scenario functionality.</li><li><strong>CUI modules</strong>: make it easy to develop conversational user interactions.</li><li><strong>Providers</strong>: allow you to integrate with various backends to schedule reservations. For example, you can use Google Calendar to schedule customers&#39; reservations.</li></ul><p>We encourage you to build upon our scenario by defining more modules or extensions to meet your specific needs. Your contributions will help other businesses with similar needs to benefit from your work. We strive to provide a comprehensive reservation scenario for chatbots that is continually updated with new features, enhancements, and application examples.</p><p>Overall, our reservation scenario project aims to simplify and streamline the chatbot building process for you, saving you time and effort while delivering a seamless and convenient experience for your customers.</p><p>Select the document below to see more details:</p><h4 id="api-reference" tabindex="-1"><a href="./reservation-api.html">API Reference</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#api-reference" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[API Reference](reservation-api.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Reservation service interface, exposes most of the features available in the reservation scenario.</p><h4 id="google-calendar" tabindex="-1"><a href="./google-calendar-reservation.html">Google Calendar</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#google-calendar" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Google Calendar](google-calendar-reservation.md)&quot;">​</a></h4><p>A backend provider implement reservation service interface, you can use a domain calendar to schedule customers&#39; reservations.</p>',14),s=[n];function i(c,l,h,d,u,p){return o(),a("div",null,s)}const v=e(r,[["render",i]]);export{f as __pageData,v as default};
