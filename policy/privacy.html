As affected customers who relied only on our Privacy Shield certification transition to the use of Standard Contractual Clauses and other methods for transferring Personal Information to OpenCUI under the GDPR, OpenCUI will continue to honor our obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information.
