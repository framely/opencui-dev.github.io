Changes to the service <a class="header-anchor" href="#_10-changes-to-the-service" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;10. Changes to the service&quot;">​</a></h2><p>OpenCUI is constantly innovating and finding ways to provide our users with new features and services. Therefore, we may, without prior notice, change the Service, add features, stop providing the Service or features of the Service to you or to users generally, or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate, downgrade, suspend, or prohibit your access to the Service without prior notice and liability for any or no reason, including if, in our sole determination, you violate any provision of this Agreement. You may discontinue or terminate your use of the Service at any time.</p><h2 id="_11-amendments-notification-procedures-and-updates-to-the-agreement" tabindex="-1">11.

Amendments, notification procedures, and updates to the agreement&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, update, or change these Terms from time to time (such modified Terms, the &quot;Updated Terms&quot;), so we encourage you to review this page periodically. Notwithstanding, when we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the “Last Modified” date at the top of this page and use reasonable efforts to provide you with reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. OpenCUI may provide such notifications, whether the notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on the Service, as determined by OpenCUI in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification by contacting us at <a href="mailto:contact@OpenCUI.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">contact@OpenCUI.io</a>. You may be required to click-to-accept or otherwise agree to these Updated Terms, but in any event your continued use or access of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms and any Updated Terms before using the Service. Updated Terms will be effective as of the date specified in the “Last Modified” date at the top of this page, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. The previous Terms (or Updated Terms) will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the applicable Updated Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms or any future Updated Terms, you may not use or access (and must discontinue any use or access to) the Service. OpenCUI is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.</p><h2 id="_12-miscellaneous" tabindex="-1">12.
